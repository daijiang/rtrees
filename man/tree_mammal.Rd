\title{Mega-tree of mammals from PHYLACINE.}
\format{A phylogeny with class "phylo". It is also a list. Compare with a normal phylo object, it has another data frame \code{tree_mammal$genus_family_root}, which provides the root nodes information for every unique genus and family in the phylogeny. Such information can be used to insert new tips onto the phylogeny later.}
